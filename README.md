# learning-block-exchangeability
Code from working paper. The objective is to detect block-exchangeable structures in correlation matrices. Functions and examples are provided.

See https://www.researchgate.net/project/Detection-of-Exchangeable-Structures-in-Correlation-Matrices for more info.

# functions
Contains all original functions used for the main simulation study of the paper. They are somewhat outdated as more efficient procedures are available in the two "application" folders

# simulation-study2-scripts
Contains modified functions and scripts for the simulation study in high-dimensional settings.
Note that modifications are needed in order to run the scripts... (To be done, if necessary. It might never be needed anymore.)
Also contains scripts that generate the tables for the paper (there are very small errors in the tables of the paper, they will be corrected in the next version).

# simulation-study2-results
Contains the results obtained with the scripts in simulation-study2-scripts.

# application-NASDAQ100
Contains necessary scripts to apply the algorithm when the number of variables is relatively large settings (on stocks data).

# application-1330
Contains a toy example with 1330 variables and 29 observations developped for an application to data that cannot be made available.
