# learning-block-exchangeability
Code from working paper. The objective is to detect block-exchangeable structures in correlation matrices. Functions and examples are provided. (In progress.)

See https://www.researchgate.net/project/Detection-of-Exchangeable-Structures-in-Correlation-Matrices for more info.

# functions
Contains all original functions used for the most part of the simulation study (not in the repo).

# simulation-study2-scripts
Contains modified functions and scripts for the simulation study in high-dimensional settings.

Note that modifications are needed in order to run the scripts... (To be done, if necessary. It might never be needed anymore.)

# simulation-study2-results
Contains the results obtained with the scripts in simulation-study2-scripts.

# application-NASDAQ100
Contains necessary scripts to apply the algorithm in high-dimensional settings on real data coming from the NASDAQ 100 index.
(Might also need modifications. These will be done shortly.)
